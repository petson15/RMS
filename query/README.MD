**README: SQL Code Installation for Creating Tables and Database**

This README provides instructions on how to install and run the SQL code to create tables and a database using WAMP or XAMPP. The SQL code will allow you to set up the necessary database structure for your application.

**Prerequisites:**

- Ensure that you have WAMP or XAMPP installed on your local machine.
- Start the WAMP or XAMPP server and make sure it is running.

**Installation Steps:**

1. Download the SQL code files to your local machine.

2. Locate the directory where you have installed WAMP or XAMPP. In most cases, it will be something like `C:\wamp` or `C:\xampp`.

3. Inside the installation directory, locate the "www" or "htdocs" folder. This is the root directory for your local web server.

4. Copy the SQL code files into the "www" or "htdocs" folder.

5. Open a web browser and type `localhost` in the address bar. This will open the WAMP or XAMPP dashboard.

6. Click on the appropriate tool for managing your database (e.g., phpMyAdmin).

7. Create a new database by clicking on the "Databases" tab and entering a name for your database.

8. Open the SQL code file in a text editor or a SQL client.

9. In the SQL code file, locate the section where the database is selected (`USE database_name;`). Replace `database_name` with the name of the database you created in step 7.

10. Run the SQL code by either copying and pasting it into the SQL query window of your database management tool or importing the SQL file directly into the tool.

11. Execute the SQL code to create the tables and database structure.

12. Once the SQL code has been executed successfully, you should see a message indicating that the tables were created.

13. You can now use the created tables and database for your application.

**Notes:**

- Make sure you review the SQL code files before executing them to ensure they meet your requirements and do not overwrite any existing data.
- It is recommended to backup any existing databases or tables before running the SQL code.
- Remember to secure your database by setting strong passwords and restricting access to authorized users only.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install and run the SQL code to create tables and a database using WAMP or XAMPP.
